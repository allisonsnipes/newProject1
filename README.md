Proposal

Concept: Providing an application to better secure the safety of activists and journalist freedom and safety.

Motivation: To provide an outlet for government accountability, media coverage, and safety for at risk individuals participating in civil disobedience. After documentary watching a documentary on several missing persons (who were journalist or activists)  a common denominator was found: all persons lost contact with their loved ones at some-point—and often times their family members could not provide clear information to to the authorities.

Design Process: 
Navbar (menus for governement contacts for users area, media contacts, legal aid contact, FAQs and advice)
Body  
Sidebar 
Button for active threat, safe, and monitor mode
Input textbox for family and friends’ contact information

Technology Used:
MDN Geospatial API: was used to get the longitude and latitude coordinates.
Google Maps API: we used the functionality of longitude and latitude coordinates from MDN API to reverse geolocate users.
